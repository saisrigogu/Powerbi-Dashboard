Sales Performance Dashboard
I created a Sales Performance Dashboard in Power BI to understand and show how a business is performing in terms of sales and profit. The dashboard includes:
Total sales by region (North, South, East, and West)
Sales through online and retail channels shown in a pie chart
Profit by different product categories like electronics and furniture
Monthly sales trends shown using a line chart
Key values like total sales, total profit, and average discount shown clearly using cards
Filters to view the data by region, product category, or date
